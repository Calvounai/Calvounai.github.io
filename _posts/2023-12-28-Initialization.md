### Computational Study of the Influence of Metal Oxides and Peroxides in Thermoplastic Elastomers

On this research I'm studying a system formed by a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) (XHNBR especifically), metal oxides (MgO and ZnO mainly) and polyamide 6 (PA6).
Experimentally, first the system `TPE + metal oxide` is prepared, and then it's mixed with the `PA6`.

So, the initial idea was to study the interactions between TPE (small fragments and monomer/dimer) and different metal oxides, with the objetive of finding a good substitute of ZnO (which is toxic).
For that, DFT with the level of theory `wB97XD/6-31+G(d,p)` for the geometrical optimziation, and for the single point calculations `wB97XD/6-311++G(2df,2p)` has been used.

Summary of the results: MgO is the one which gives closser results to the ones with ZnO.

Also, to confirm that the model of nanoparticle used to represent the metal oxides is appropriate (Mg12O12), surface simulations will be performed using VASP. The idea is that I'll create a surface of MgO (ZnO also, just to check), and add some small fragments of the TPE to calculate the interaction energies. The ideal result would be one that shows same order of magnitude of interactions than on the nanoparticle model DFT calculations, thus demonstrating that the nanoparticle model is adequate to describe the system.

After VASP calculations, all those results will be published on a paper!! (Happy face :D)
