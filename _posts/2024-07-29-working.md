## Non-Lewis covalent interactions

Today, july 29th, I did my Master Thesis defense! It was great, but now I have a lot of work to do yet.

### Description

One of the comments given by Xabi was about the characterization process of the interactions. He explained that I used too much the expresion 'electrostatic' word.
The explaination is the next one: with NBO what I'm describing are not electrostatic interactions, but non-Lewin covalent interactions.
These interactions involve some degree of electron sharing or transfer between orbitals, but they do not conform to the classical Lewis structure model, which strictly defines bonds and lone pairs.
In NBO analysis, second-order perturbation energies arise from interactions where electron density is delocalized from a donor orbital to an acceptor orbital. These interactions reflect a covalent character because they involve the redistribution of electron density rather than simple electrostatic attraction or repulsion.
These are termed 'non-Lewis' because they do not form part of the classical Lewis strucuture's bonding framework. Instead, they represent delocalized interactions htat enhace stability through partial covalent character.

Using the term “covalent non-Lewis interactions” more accurately describes the nature of the interactions observed in NBO analysis:

	•	Delocalization: It emphasizes the delocalization of electron density, which is a hallmark of covalent bonding.
	•	Bonding Nature: It highlights that these interactions have a bonding character, albeit not fitting the classical description of covalent bonds in Lewis structures.
	•	Chemical Insight: It provides a clearer understanding of the stabilization mechanisms in molecules, recognizing that these interactions go beyond simple electrostatics.

### Practical Implication

When you observe significant second-order perturbation energies in NBO analysis, these indicate stabilizing interactions due to electron delocalization. These are better described as covalent non-Lewis interactions because they involve electron sharing and are not purely electrostatic.

### Conclusion

Referring to the interactions indicated by second-order perturbation energies from NBO analysis as covalent non-Lewis interactions is more accurate and informative. It acknowledges the partial covalent character of these interactions, which involve electron delocalization and stabilization mechanisms beyond simple electrostatic forces. This terminology provides a more nuanced understanding of the electronic structure and stability of molecules.

### Updates

Maybe there is no need for deeper characterizations, since we understand that the interactions are mainly electrostatic. We could perform: QTAIM (not Bader), EDA, NEDA, or Coulomb charge analysis. To think about this.
Also, I could think of our system as a Bronsted base (and analyze the bi-dentated interactions with the deprotonated polymer).
